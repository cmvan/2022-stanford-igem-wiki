    bio: "Angel is a sophomore from Houston, TX planning on majoring in Bioengineering and getting a coterm in Computer Science. His previous experience mainly consists of personal coding, finance, and robotics projects. After taking IB Biology in HS, bio tech became a huge interest that he’s currently exploring. With the current iGEM team, he hopes to gain wet lab skill and web development experience. Outside of academics, Angel loves to play soccer, chess and video games. Recently he began learning how to play guitar and has taken playing chess and soccer more seriously. He loves to meet new people and make new experiences.",
    attribution: "Angel is our financial officer and logistics coordinator. He played a vital role in fundraising the financial need for the team to travel and attend the iGEM competition. This included reaching out to both on and off campus financial resources and filling applications for grants. Additionally, this included following proper protocols to reach out to companies/accept deposits for student organizations. For the educational program, Angel formally reached out and registered the students on Stanford websites for approval. He would also coordinate with the ASSU and OSE offices at Stanford to ensure the team had approval for travel, fundraising, and to host a virtual summer program."

    catchphrase: "Claudia's Catchphrase",
    bio: "Claudia is a junior from Michigan majoring in Bioengineering, with a minor in German Studies. Previously, Claudia has done research on the metabolic and pathogenic behavior of fungi under Dr. Linda Hanson and the structure-function relationships of eye proteins under Dr. Vinit Mahajan. She is looking forward to deepening her knowledge of structural biology through hands-on protein engineering with the iGEM team this summer. When she isn’t in the lab, Claudia writes Science Olympiad exams and coaches local teams, trains and competes with the Stanford Taekwondo team, and knits hats.",
    attribution: "Claudia worked extensively on software and data curation. When she wasn’t modeling the PETase docking mechanism or investigating PETase phylogeny, she was making mold prototypes in CAD for gasket design, managing supply orders for project materials, running the Protein Biochemistry and Modeling education lecture, and helping write and narrate the script for the promo video. Claudia researched and designed the S160C rational design mutant and helped construct and clone the mutants in the lab. Fun fact: Claudia is also the member who came up with our project name, MORPH!"

She particularly enjoys research revolving around genetic editing technology and healthcare disparities. Additionally, she is involved with the Stanford Premedical Association Health Policy Committee, undergraduate senate, and a group advocating for First-generation and/or low-income students known as FLIP. She aspires to become an Orthopedic surgeon and go into global surgery, while continuing to complete research. Aside from her academics, she loves nature, gardening, and long walks.",
    attribution: "Gurmenjit worked on leading the team in lab work, which included cloning to optimize PETase and cloning of rationally designed Petase for the ortho rep system. Additionally, Gurmenjit was involved in developing gasket prototypes. She worked on the development of sensors for screening successful PETase degradation of PET. Beyond facilitating meetings with other iGEM teams, she helped run the education program—from designing the graphic to sending logistical information and homework feedback. During the education program, she lectured about model organisms with the Yale iGEM team, served as a panelist, and facilitated the speaker series. Lastly, she assisted in the registration of parts into the iGEM database. "
